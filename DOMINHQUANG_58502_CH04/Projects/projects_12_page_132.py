Problem:
12. The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period
in a text file. The format of each line of the file is the following:
<last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>
Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the terminal a
report of the wages paid to the employees for the given period. The report should
be in tabular format with the appropriate header. Each line should contain an
employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the wages paid for that period.
Solution:

"""
# Put your code here
filename = input("Enter the file name: ")
inputfile = open(filename, 'r')
print('\n%-15s%-10s%-10s' % ('Name', 'Hours', 'Total Pay'))
for line in inputfile:
    dataList = line.split()
    name = str(dataList[0])
    hours = int(dataList[1])
    payRate = float(dataList[2])
    totalPay = hours *payRate
print('%-15s%-10d%-10.2f' %(name,hours,totalPay))
