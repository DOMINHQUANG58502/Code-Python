Problem:
1. Explain the relationship between a function and its arguments.

Solution:
1/Relationship between function and its arguments is as follows:
• The function is the chunk of code that is defined to perform a particular task Arguments data values that are used by the function to perform some task
• Arguments may or may not be used in the function
• Arguments can be required as well as it can be optional
    For example, in function round(argarg2, arg1 is the required argument whereas arg is the optional argument
• If required arguments are not passed into the function then it will give an ear but feeling arguments are not passed then it will not grve any error
