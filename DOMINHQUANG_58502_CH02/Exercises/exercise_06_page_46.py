Problem:
6. List two of the purposes of program documentation
Solution:
   1. Begin a program with a statement of its purpose and other information that would
help orient a programmer called on to modify the program at some future date.
   2. Precede major segments of code with brief comments that explain their purpose.
The case study program presented earlier in this chapter does this.
