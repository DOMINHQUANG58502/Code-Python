Problem:
  1. List four phases of the software development process, and explain what they
accomplish.
Solution:

  1.Analysis—The programmers determine what the program will do.
  This is some times viewed as a process of clarifying the specifications for the problem
  2.Design—The programmers determine how the program will do its task.
  3.Implementation—The programmers write the program. This step is also called the
coding phase.
  4.Integration—Large programs have many parts.
    In the integration phase, these parts are brought together into a smoothly functioning whole, usually not an easy task.
