Problem:
5. An object’s momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity. Write a program
that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as
inputs and then outputs its momentum.

Solution:

"""
mass=float(input("Enter the object's mass: "))
velocity=float(input("Enter the object's velocity: "))

momentum =  mass * velocity
print("\nThe object's momentum is ", momentum)
