Problem:
5. What is the purpose of a main function?

Solution:
The main function serves as the starting point for program execution.
It usually controls program execution by directing the calls to other functions in the program.
 A program usually stops executing at the end of main, although it can terminate at other points in the program for a variety of reasons.
