Problem:
2. What is object instantiation? What are the options at the programmerâ€™s disposal
during this process?
Solution:
-Instantiating a class is creating a copy of the class which inherits all class variables and methods. To instantiate a class, we simply call the class as if it were a function, passing the arguments that the __init__ method defines. ...
The return value will be the newly created object.
 In object-oriented programming, some writers say that you instantiate a class to create an object, a concrete instance of the class.
  The object is an executable file that you can run in a computer.
