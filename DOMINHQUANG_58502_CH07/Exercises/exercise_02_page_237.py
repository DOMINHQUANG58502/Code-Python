Problem:
2. The size of an image is 1680 pixels by 1050 pixels. Assume that this image has been
sampled using the RGB color system and placed into a raw image file. What is the
minimum size of this file in megabytes? (Hint: There are 8 bits in a byte, 1024 bits in
a kilobyte, and 1000 kilobytes in a megabyte.)
Solution:
size image is: 1680 x 1050 = 1764000 pixels
1764000  pixels X 16 bit = 28224000 รท 8bits = 3528000 Bytes รท 1024 = 3445.3125 Kilobytes รท 1000 = 3.445
