Problem:
4. The functions that draw polygons in the polygons module have the same pattern, varying
only in the number of sides (iterations of the loop). Factor this pattern into a more general
function named polygon, which takes the number of sides as an additional argument.
Solution:
The wild represents the window associated with the turtle and the Canvas, representing
the area where the turtle can move and draw lines. A canvas can be larger than its window, only visible
the area of the canvas that is visible to the user.
