Problem:
2. Explain how an algorithm solves a general class of problems and how a function
definition can support this property of an algorithm.
Solution:
The algorithms in turn are composed of built-in operators, control statements, calls to built-in functions,
and programmer-defined functions
responsible for using certain data, computing certain results, and returning these to the parts of the program
that requested them. Each of the tasks required by a system can be assigned to a function, including the tasks
of managing or coordinating the use of other functions
